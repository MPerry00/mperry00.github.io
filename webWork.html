      <h2><a href="http://mperry00.github.io/assignment3.html">Assignment 3: Encyclopedia Page</a></h2>
      <p>For this assignment, we were to use our new skills to replicate a wikipedia page. This helped us practice
      hyperlinking and inserting pictures. For my wikipedia page, I replicated the Wikipedia page about the Bee Hummingbird,
      which can be found <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_hummingbird">here.</a></p>

      to include atleast one picture as well.</p>

      <p>For this assignment, I had to set up the required technology for this course. Since we hadn't been able
      to learn much HTML specifics within the first week, we just had to create a page that said "Hello World."</p>

          <h4>For Fun</h4>
          <p>Outside of school, I've really loved to explore Colorado by spending my time skiing or hiking. I'm very passionate about traveling
            and broadening my global mindset through international experiences. Recently, I purchased an old sewing machine and have been trying
            to teach myself how to sew. </p>

          <p>I was born and raised in northern Virgina, just outside of Washington DC. My family, including my mother and my 2 siblings, still live
            there with our puppy and 2 cats.</p>
          <h4>Education</h4>
          <p>I am currently a senior at the University of Colorado in Boulder studying Marketing and Business Analytics.
            In addition, I am working towards a minor in Creative Technology and Design as well as a Business Leadership Certificate. </p>
          <h4>Extra Curricular Activities</h4>
          <p>I've been very fortunate to have the opportunity to be very involved within the business school. For the majority of my
            college experience, I served on the executive board of the international professional fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi. Through my involvement
            with the Leeds Scholars Program, I have had the opportunity to be a part of community service projects around the Boulder and Denver area as well
            as engage in an international consulting project with a small winery in South Africa. In addition, I've been working 2 on campus jobs, including an
            accounting job for the engineering school as well as a peer advisor at the Leeds advising office. </p>
          <h4>Future</h4>
          <p>After I graduate in the spring of 2022, I plan to move out to Seattle, Washington to live in the city. I am extremely excited to
            be working for Deloitte Consulting in their Application and Program Analyst program. </p>

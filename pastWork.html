      <h1>Past Work</h1>
      <p>During my time at CU Boulder, I have been working towards receiving a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration
      with an emphasis on Marketing and Business Analytics. In addition, I am working towards receiving a certificate in Busienss
      Leadership as well as a minor in Creative Technology and Design.</p>
      <p>To highlight some of the work I have completed during my time at CU, I have created blog pages that highlight some of my work.
      By clicking on the specified link below, you can see some of my work for all of these areas of my educational experience. As I am still in
      some of these courses, the web pages are still a work in process.</p>

      <h3>Goals for this course...</h3>
      <p>In this class, I am really excited to learn more about markdown languages
        and their capabilities. One of my goals is to be able to create a working webpage
        that I am proud of. In addition, I hope to gain the foundational knowledge that will
        allow me to continue to explore HTML on my own.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
      <p>I am originally from northern Virginia and traveled out to Colorado for school.
        I am a senior in the business school studying Marketing and Business Analytics,
        as well as receiving a business leadership certificate. Next fall, I will be
        trading out the mountains in sunny Boulder for the ocean
        in rainy Seattle. In addition to exploring my new home on the west coast, I will
        be working as an Application and Program Analyst at Deloitte Consulting.</p>
      <p><strong>Pets:</strong> At home, the house is filled with four fluffy pets. We have
        three cats, Lucy, Ginny, and Milo, who are always getting into trouble. And if the
        cats weren't enough, we decided to adopt a puppy almost 3 years ago and named him
        Obi.</p>

      <p><strong>Newest hobby:</strong> Recently, I've been really interested in learning
        to sew. For Christmas, I got an old sewing machine and have been messing around with it inbetween
        classes and work. While I wouldn't say this is my favorite YouTube video, it is definitely the
        one I have watched the most recently.

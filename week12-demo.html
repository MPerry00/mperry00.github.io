    <h3>Explain extension:</h3>
    <p>In class we created a random cat fact generator, which returned a new fact about a cat each time
    the button was clicked. For this weeks assignment, we were supposed to find a new API source and
    extend the quote machine in some way using a combination of JavaScript, CSS and HTML.</p>
    <p>I extended this page by incorporating an animation with the generator button. As you can see,
    when the user goes to the page the "generate" button appears to slide in from the right side of the screen
    to the middle. On top of this, I also incorporated the color scheme of the rest of my website.</p>
